# Tic Tac Toe Web Application

## Description
This part of the project corresponds to the frontend layer of the tic-tac-toe application. It was designed to demonstrate the possibilities of interacting with the backend through a web browser. Users can create a new game or join an existing one and then make moves using a graphical interface.

## What is it for?
The frontend serves as the user interface for the tic-tac-toe game, allowing interaction with the backend. It is an educational component showing how to create a dynamic web application communicating with the server using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including jQuery and AJAX).

## Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating the structure, styles, and logic of the application.
- jQuery: Facilitates DOM manipulation and event handling.
- AJAX: For asynchronous communication with the backend.

## Launching
To launch the web application, open the `index.html` file in a browser. Ensure that the backend is running to enable full functionality of the application.
